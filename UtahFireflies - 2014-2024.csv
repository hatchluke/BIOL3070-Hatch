They were flying low and also up above us at times. I did not count blinks per 10 seconds but will go back and do so.

The fireflies were down in a wet meadow east of the man made fishing ponds. Going back in the daytime there were maybe a dozen horses in the same area.

This sight has been visited several times in June by myself and other USFS, DWR, and NPS biologists, as far as I know no one else has reported the sightings. from June 1, and 2nd. We could see 50-75 fireflies on the west side of the road in tall grass and about 25 on the east side. There was a house to the north east with many lights on preventing good viewing in that direction.
